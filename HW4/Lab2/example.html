        <p>
            Welcome to the layout lab. This page contains the instructions for what to do...with this page. First,
            download this file, create a CSS file to go along with it, and &lt;link&gt; it from the &lt;head&gt; section of the page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then, follow the instructions in this page to set various layout properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            Wrap the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; at the beginning of the page in a &lt;header&gt;, and center them with the
            <code>text-align</code> property.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Below this text is the main content area. It should be 70% wide, and centered in the page.
            Wrap the two columns together into one page section (&lt;main&gt;), and make that page section a
            flex container by setting it's <code>display</code> property to <code>flex</code>.
        </p>

        <!-- main area -->
        <main>
          <!-- left column -->
          
          <aside class ="columns">
            
            <h3>Left column</h3>
          
            <p>
                This column sits on the left of the main area. Wrap this column in a page section that indicates that it is
                an &lt;aside&gt; for the page.
            </p>
          
            <p>        
                It takes up 1/3 of the width of the overall content area. Accomplish this by setting the
		  	        <code>flex-basis</code> property to <code>33%</code>.<!--<code>1</code>. Note this
                this is a unitless value, and only makes sense in comparison to the <code>flex-basis</code> of the other
			          column, which we'll set to <code>2</code>.-->
            </p>
          
          </aside>
          <!-- end left column -->

          <!-- right column -->
          <div class="columns">
            
            <h3>Right column</h3>
            
            <p>
                This column is on the right of the main content area. It takes up 2/3 of the main content area width.
			          Accomplish this by setting it's <code>flex-basis</code> to <code>66%</code>.<!-- <code>2</code>. Flex-basis is a weird "unitless"
                measure &mdash; this means that the <code>flex-basis</code> numbers are all simply relative to the other items
  			        in the container.-->
            </p>
  
            <img src="./example_files/puppy-mowgli.jpg" alt="puppies">
            
            <p>
                Float the above image to the right, so that it's to the right of this text instead of above it. Set it's
                <code>width</code> to <code>200px</code> so that it isn't so huge. The height will adjust to keep the scale
                of the image.
            </p>
  
            <p id="paragraph">
                For this paragraph, we don't want the text to wrap around the floating image anymore. Use
                <code>clear: both</code> to cause this paragraph to move down below the floating image. Give it an
                <code>id</code> or a <code>class</code> so that you can select this paragraph specifically in your CSS.
            </p>
          
          </div>
          <!-- end right column -->

        </main>
        <!-- end main area -->

        <p>
            Both columns should have <code>2em</code> of padding, <code>2em</code> of margin, and a <code>4px</code>
            dashed red border. Give both columns a class that they can share so that you don't have to duplicate this
            box model CSS.
        </p>

        <p id="finalpart">
            Finally, use <code>position: fixed</code> to set the position of this paragraph element so that is is
            <code>5px</code> away from the bottom of the browser view port. Depending on how big your browser screen is,
            other text from the page might overlap with it. That proves to be a big challenge with fixed position
            elements.
